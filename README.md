# UFOs
## Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this project was to make a webpage with a table that could be updated to filter through data regarding UFO sightings.

## Results: 
https://vrynerson.github.io/UFOs/

To look up UFO sighting data from the webpage pasted above, a user would have to type in what kind of data they were looking for into the respective fields on the lower left of the webpage. After entering the data, the table to the right will automatically update after 10 seconds, or immediately if the user pushes the return/enter key on their keyboard.

* Example 1: The user types in "1/12/2010" into the "Enter Date" field. The red arrows indicate where the user should type their information. The following results will show:

* Example 2: The user wants to search by state and shape. The red arrows indicate where the user should type their information. The following results will show for state: "or" and shape: "triangle":

## Summary: 
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
A drawback of the filtering field design is ease of use. Most people are expecting a button to start their search results.

For further development, adding buttons to initiate the filtered search refresh and to clear the fields so the user could start new without manually clearing the field themselves. Another development change could be updating the code to allow capitalized proper nouns, i.e. San Diego vs san diego. Currently, only all lower case words will work in the search.
